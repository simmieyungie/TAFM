Here's a breakdown of the key data used:\n","\n","* **Account Rating:** Summarizes the types of credit accounts (e.g., auto, home, personal loans) and their performance (good vs. bad). This helps assess the borrower's credit mix and identify potential risk areas.\n","\n","* **Credit Account Summary:** Provides an overview of the borrower's credit health, including their credit rating, outstanding debt, and delinquency status. Key fields include rating, amountarrear, totalaccounts, totaloutstandingdebt, etc.\n","\n","* **Enquiry History:** Tracks inquiries made about the borrower's credit report (enquiryhistorytop). Frequent inquiries can signal financial stress.\n","\n","* **Personal Details:**  Includes basic demographics like gender, birthdate, and dependants, which can provide additional context for risk assessment.\n","\n","* **Account Monthly Payment History:** Contains detailed payment history (m01 to m24) for each account. This data is used to engineer a **payment_consistency** score, which quantifies how reliably the borrower makes payments. This score, ranging from 0 to 1, is calculated by assigning weights to the payment codes in the m01 to m24 fields and calculating a weighted average. A higher score indicates more consistent on-time payments and generally suggests lower credit risk.\n","\n","## **Final Fields:**\n","**Credit Summary and Account Information**\n","\n","1. rating: Overall credit score or risk rating.
